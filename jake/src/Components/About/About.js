		 in hopes to one day work in a field related to sports. Despite his field of study, 
		 Jake is also fascinated in Web Application Design as well as Mobile Application Design.
		  When Jake isn't on the ice playing hockey, hard at work studying engineering, or programming
		   he also enjoys bartending partime at the local bar.
