	    <p>
	      I grew up in Canada and spent most of my youth as a passionate competitive hockey player.
		 Hockey has motivated me to pursue a degree in Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering 
		 in hopes to one day work in a field related to sports. 
		 </p>

		 <p>As well as my field of study, 
		 I am fascinated in Web Application Design as well as Mobile Application Design. Most of my 
		 life consists of studying for my engineering degree, playing hockey and programming. In my free time I
		 enjoy keeping an active social environment by hanging out with my friends or bartending partime at the local bar. 
		 </p>

		 <p>
		 	I am always looking for ways to advance my career and interests. 
			If you would like to find out more about my work please refer to the "Projects" section of this site to see some of my
			Mechanical, Web App and Mobile App projects.
