		 <p className="mv5"> The March Networks MAPK (Motion Activated Party Keg) was a project I worked on while on an internship with March Networks. The MAPK serves purpose to detect motion when you and your friends raise your body and cheer. From watching the winning championship hockey game to beer pong winners, the MAPK will always be there to capture the moment. The camera on top of the keg detects motion at an area the user may calibrate themselves. Once motions detection occurs a red party light will flash and the users customizable favourite song will play.
